Review docs/PHASE2_2_CONTEXTUAL_MEMORY.md design doc and provide:

1. Overall score (1-10)
2. Pros list
3. Cons and Risks list  
4. Improvement suggestions

Focus on these aspects:
- Is the architecture reasonable? Over-designed or under-designed?
- Are the 4 new fields (context_tags_json, emotional_valence, related_ids_json, session_id) sufficient?
- Is ContextExtractor keyword matching too simple? Need smarter methods?
- Are MemoryLinker thresholds (0.4-0.8) reasonable?
- Performance risk: will doing extraction+linking in put() slow down writes?
- Any missing edge cases or risks?
- Is the implementation timeline realistic?

Output in Chinese.
